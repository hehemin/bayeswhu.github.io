## What is R?

- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

- R has become the world-wide language for statistics, predictive analytics, and data visualization.

## What can you do with R?

- Do calculations

- Perform statistic analysis

- Create graphics

- Write your own functions

## Why R?

- Technical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs

- Efficient functions and data structures for data analysis

- Powerful graphics

- Access to fast growing number of analysis packages

## Comparison to other software

- Stata: It can handle all kinds of econometrics research. Many packages available

- SAS: It is really good for big data set, but the grammar is really weird.

- Matlab: I could not compare it directly to R since it is a mathematical software instead of a statistic one. The only problem may be the size.

- Others do not be very popular in economic field. SPSS may be good for management student; Eviews specializes more in time series analysis and a little bit out of date.

- And the most important factor: you need to pay for them.

## Object

- The object of this workshop is to collect students who are interesting in R, so that we all have a chance to discuss the application of R in economics.

## Reference

- There is no textbook for this workshop.

- Instead, we have several reference books.

- You could find all of them on the internet, or buy the Chinese version for some of them.

## Reference

“R in action - Data analysis and graphics with R”

## Workshop Description

- This will be a full English workshop. We will use English everywhere except conversation. 

- There is no exam. We will have a lot of practice and homework to do.

- We will meet twice a week, until the number of students are less than 5.

- You need to bring your laptop to the school of economics. This is a kind of cost to identify the students who are really interesting in R.

## Schedule

- We wil first introduce the basic of R, including the materials in “R in Action”, “ggplot2”, and “Applied Econometrics with R”.

- The next step is to use what we have learned to do the econometrics exercise as much as possible.

- You guys need to prepare to learn it by yourself and help each other.

## Questions?

- Time

- Location

## Questions?

- A good question is much more important than the good or right answer.

- Learn to be a undergraduate student.

## Homework 0

- Install [R](http://www.r-project.org).

- You will not like the ugly R interface. I suggest the beautiful [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/)
